# Implementation Request

Route this implementation request through HIVE for proper skill coordination.

HIVE should:
1. Check speckit artifacts exist (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
2. If artifacts missing, delegate to appropriate speckit agent first
3. Identify required technology skills and SPAWN if needed
4. Delegate to @speckit.implement when ready

User's implementation request follows in this conversation.
