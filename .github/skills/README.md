# HIVE Skills (Capabilities)

Capabilities map to skills. Each capability should be represented as a skill folder under .github/skills/.

## Format
Each skill lives in:

.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

Recommended sections in each SKILL.md:
- Purpose (what capability this represents)
- Inputs/Outputs
- Tools/Constraints
- Success criteria
- Non-goals

## Role labels (identifiers only)
We use human role labels solely as identifiers for capabilities. They do not imply hierarchy.

Examples:
- "Frontend" → ui-rendering
- "Backend" → api-integration
- "QA" → testing
- "DevOps" → devops
